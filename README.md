# BankItems_MailWatch

**Keep an eye on your mail!**

*Please note: This addon requires BankItems and a LDB display such as [ChocolateBar](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/chocolatebar) (my favorite) or [Bazooka](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bazooka) or whichever you prefer.*

[BankItems](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bank-items "BankItems") keeps a track of all your toons' mail boxes contents; BankItems_MailWatch simply scans this data to remind you which toon has mail pending and how long the mail will stay in their inbox before it is returned or lost.

Note: this will only work with mail already known by BankItems. Mail sent to you by friends, guildies or in-game NPCs will not show up until you open your toon's mailbox.


## Need help?

I rarely read comments here on Curse.com; should you need any help, you'd better open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Septh/WoW-BankItems_MailWatch "GitHub repository"), where the projet lives.
