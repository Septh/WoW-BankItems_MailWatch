# BankItems_MailWatch
#### Keep an eye on your mail!####

*Please note: This addon requires BankItems and a LDB display such as ChocolateBar (my favorite) or Bazooka or whichever you prefer.*

[BankItems](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bank-items "BankItems") keeps a track of all your toons' mail boxes contents; BankItems_MailWatch simply scans this data to remind you which toon has mail pending and how long the mail will stay in their inbox before it is returned or lost.

Note: this will only work with mail already known by BankItems. Mail sent to you by friends, guildies or in-game NPCs will not show up until you open your toon's mailbox.
